Making this blog was my introduction to **NextJS**. Prior to this, I have had experience with Javascript and CSS as well as _some_ experience with React.

I learned about creating different pages, and linking them with the **Link** element that is packaged with NextJS. I also learned about creating dynamic routes.

Utilizing the gray-matter library was very interesting, because it could parse the markdown files and extract the relevent data to be displayed on the app.

Additionally, I learned about using the Remark library to display markdown files as HTML.
